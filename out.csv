We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(What kind of dress you're wearing tonight)
(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Ooh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
I love this song

"We Don't Talk Anymore"
(feat. Selena Gomez)

Lyrics

[Charlie Puth:]
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do.

I just heard you found the one you've been looking—
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez:]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez:]
That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

We don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight, oh
If he's holding onto you so tight, oh
The way I did before

We don't talk anymore

I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game, oh
Now I can't get you out of my brain, whoa
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore

Selena Gomez is cheating on Justin Bieber
i doubt anyone will take the time to read this but I'm hoping at least one person will 

my name is Shay, i'm a young singer chasing a dream, i want to sing more than anything and it's so hard to get some recognition on here, but i post covers of my favourite songs on my channel

i know i have a long way to go but i aspire to release songs and albums one day but i need some support to get there, please give me a chance and just 3 minutes of your time to listen to my videos and let me know what you think, every single view, like and comment means a lot to me

Please make sure you thumbs up this comment so others will be able to see it

thank you so much, i look forward to reading your comments🖤
I was fallow since 2018 to 2561
